## General Information

BoomBikes, a US based bike-sharing provider which provides bikes for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

The project is about analyzing past data and understanding impact of different variables on the bike rentals. The different features impacting rentals are analyzed and a linear model fitted to come up with a prediction. 



## Conclusions
The data showed that year and temerature are the biggest factors influencing rentals, followed by light snow/rain.



## Technologies Used
- Pandas for data handling
- sklearn for statics and linear regression
